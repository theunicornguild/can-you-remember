To start creating our project we need to do the following steps:

1. Install yarn
2. Create a React App

**What is `yarn`?**
Yarn is a `JavaScript` package manager and task runner:

If you're a Mac user, install yarn using the following command in the terminal.

```shell
$ brew install yarn
```

 If you're a windows user, follow the steps [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable).

This command will install yarn globally on your device.

**How to clone the starter file?**

- Go to the project's [repo](https://github.com/CODEDHQ/can-you-remember)
- Fork the project to your github account
- Copy the url and go to your terminal/shell

After you have forked the repository, run the following commands:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/can-you-remember
$ cd can-you-remember
$ yarn install
```

This will install the same version of any libraries we have installed in this project.

**How to run my project?**

To run your project and see the changes you make live in your browser run the following command from inside your project directory:

```shell
yarn start
```

**How to create a `React App`?**
(Just a guide, you shouldn't do it if you already cloned!)

- Using the terminal go to the location on your device where you want to create the project
- Run the following command

  ```shell
   yarn create react-app can-you-remember
  ```

  This will create a folder that will contain your project files.
