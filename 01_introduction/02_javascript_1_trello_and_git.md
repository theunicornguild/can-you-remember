In this project you'll be using both `Trello` and `git`.

#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work progress. Helps you track what features you are currently working on, what feateures are left to build, and what you have already finished.

Open the projects `Trello` board, which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 5 lists:

- `IceBox`: This list has all the features that are nice to have, but not currently necessary (iceboxed).
- `Backlog`: This list has all the features that we need to build.
- `Doing`: This list has all the features that you are currently working on.
- `Review`: This list has all the features that you finished, but need to be reviewed by someone.
- `Done`: This list will have all the features that are complete and reviewed.

Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working on this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

Feel free to add some cards to the icebox now or at anytime while working on the project. You can start working on these features once you have finished everything in the backlog!

#### Git

We'll be using `git` throughout the project as a version control tool. It will help us keep track of the changes we're making to the code, and create checkpoints every time we finish a feature.

[Fork and clone](https://github.com/CODEDHQ/can-you-remember) our repo to get the starter files, including some pre-made cards with their images.
