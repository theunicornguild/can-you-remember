In this project you'll be using a tool called `Trello`

#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work and manage your project. It helps you keep track of what features are left to build and what have you already finished. Every card on the board represents a feature.

Open the project's `Trello` board, which you'll find in the `Resources` section. You'll find 4 lists:

- `IceBox`: this list has all the features that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
- `Backlog`: this list has all the features that we need to build.
- `Doing`: this list will have all the features that you are currently working on.
- `Done`: this list will have all the features that are completed.

Right now all the cards are in the `Backlog` or the `IceBox` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working on this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists. Feel free to add any feature that comes to mind to the `Icebox` so that you can build it at the end of this project,ÃŸ after all essential features are out of the way.

#### Setup Trello

After creating an account, you'll need to create a copy of the board. This will help you figure out how to [copy the board](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards). By doing that you will have a copy of the `Trello Board` in your account, and you can start using it throughout this project.
