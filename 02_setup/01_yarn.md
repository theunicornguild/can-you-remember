To start creating our project we need to do the following steps:

- Install yarn
- Create a React App

**What is `yarn`?**
Yarn is a `JavaScript` manager and a task runner:

- Install yarn using the following command
  ```shell
  $ brew install yarn
  ```
  This command will install yarn globally on your device

Now clone our starter file to get the cards we used

**How to clone the starter file?**

- Go to the project's [repo](https://github.com/khm56/can-you-remember)
- Fork the project to your github account
- Copy the url and go to your terminal/shell

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/can-you-remember
```

```shell
$ cd can-you-remembers
$ yarn install
```

this will install the same version of any libraries we have installed in this project

**How to run my project?**

- To run your project and see the changes you make live in your browser use the following commands
  ```shell
  cd can-you-remember
  yarn start
  ```
  The first command will take you into the project's folder
  The second command will run your project

**How to create a `React App`?**
(Just a guide you shouldn't do it because you already cloned)

- Using the terminal go to the location on your device where you want to create the project
- then using the following command

  ```shell
   yarn create react-app can-you-remember
  ```

  this will create a folder that will contain your project files
