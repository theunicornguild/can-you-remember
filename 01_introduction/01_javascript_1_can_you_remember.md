### What is `Can you remember?`

Can you remember is a classic memory card game where the player has to flip cards in a grid, matching the cards that have the same image on them.

In single player mode, the player can track his failed attempts. So the challenge is to finish the same difficulty with the least possible mistakes.

In multi-player mode, players take turns to flip the cards. The player who guesses right continues playing until they flip two wrong cards. The winner is the player with the highest score.

Take a look at the [demo](https://can-you-remember.netlify.com/) to get a better idea of what you're going to be building throughout this project.

The technologies that will we will be using in the project are:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (for developing the game)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (for handling the layout and design)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (for deployment)
