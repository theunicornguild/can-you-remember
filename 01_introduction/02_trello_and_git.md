In this project you'll be using both `Trello` and `git`.

#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do...what you've already finished and so on.

Open the projects `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 4 lists:
_ `IceBox`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
_ `Backlog`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that we need to do.
_ `Doing`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
_ `Review`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you finished but need to be reviewed by someone. \* `Done`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that are done.

Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project as a version control tool and to keep track of the changes we're making to the code and create checkpoints every time we finish a functionality.

You can create a new repo on [github](https://github.com/) to start your project from scratch or [Fork and clone](https://github.com/) our repo to get the same set of cards we used
