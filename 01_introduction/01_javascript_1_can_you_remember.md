### What is "Can you remember"?

Can you remember is a classic memory card game where the player has to flip cards in a grid, matching the cards that have the same image on them.

In *single player mode* the player can track his failed attempts so the challenge is to finish the same difficulty with the least possible mistakes.

In *multi player mode*, players take turns to flip the cards. A player who guesses right continues playing until they flip two wrong cards. The winner is the player with the highest score.

Take a look at the [demo website](https://can-you-remember.codeunicorn.io/) to get a better idea of what you're going to be building throughout this project.

The technologies that will be used in this project are:

- React (for developing the game)
- Bootstrap (for handling the layout and design)
- Netlify (for deployment)

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project as a version control tool and to keep track of the changes we're making to the code. We'll use git to create checkpoints every time we finish a feature. So if we make a mistake, we know where to go back to!
