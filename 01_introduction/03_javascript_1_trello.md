In this project you'll be using both `Trello`

#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What features are left to build? What have you already finished? The trello board is setup according to **agile methodology** which in brief means that every card represents a feature.

Open the projects `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 4 lists:

- `IceBox`: this list has all the features that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
- `Backlog`: this list has all the features that we need to build.
- `Doing`: this list will have all the features that you are currently working on.
- `Done`: this list will have all the features that are done.

Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` or the `IceBox` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working on this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.
